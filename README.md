**Lightweight Named Entity Recognition for Text Anonymization**

Abstract
The accelerating use of large-scale NLP systems in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and law has amplified concerns over the privacy and ethical handling of textual data. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented breakthroughs in natural language understanding, their open-ended nature and high resource demand make them ill-suited for real-time anonymization tasks—especially when computational constraints and data protection regulations are in play.

This project implements and extends the work by Deußer et al., proposing a distilled, encoder-only model for Named Entity Recognition (NER), tailored for efficient and robust text anonymization. It strikes a balance between semantic integrity and privacy compliance, offering a viable solution to anonymize unstructured text at scale while remaining faithful to real-world constraints.
